your tap)\n\n[Verse]\nYeah, in London talkin' to Rhetorik 'bout my life and shit\nI thought the album was finished but I keep writing shit\nIt's kind of funny how life changed and rearranged\nNo matter what happens, everything ain't gon' be the same\nThe incredible album, what an incredible outcome\nI grip the mic and then talk to the people like I'm Malcolm\nI used to think the fame and money was the motivation\nUntil I toured the world and met the people face to face and\nUnderstood that the power was harnessed in that basement\nIt ain't about the money and notoriety\nIt's about the people and making a difference in society\nBut don't get it twisted, this life I'm living is like a movie\nThe Godfather, the Goodfella wielding a Uzi\nOne with the people, if the people is wondering who's he?\nSame level, the same rebel that never settled\nPullin' strings like Geppeto who overcame the ghetto\nAnd I know you wrote me and I still ain't answered\nCause shit is different now\nIt's forced upon me, different stances\nI used to spend all my time conversing with you\nBut now I write this song to let you know I'm hurting with you\nShit is too big, but let's be honest man, it's kinda bittersweet\nBesides the shows and meet and greets\nY'all only see me on the street\nAnd even then, that shit is rare‚ÄîI just don't go outside\nCause honestly I don't fuck with this world, I'd rather hide\nThat misconception, \"Cause I rap, I must be filled with pride\"\nShit I ain't perfect, if you heard different then someone lied\nPeople in my ear telling me, \"Talk that shit\"\nActions speak louder than words, I'd rather walk that shit\nSince the first album\nI'm one of the highest earners on the label\nWithin six months I put the second one on they table\nI played sold out shows in parts of the world I can't pronounce\nRelease the tickets, watch them disappear when we announce\nFuck all that murderous syllable shit right now\nJust let me bounce\nThe mood around me is people smokin' it by the ounce\nLeave Friday for the show and come back Monday\nWith a hundred grand\nDon't fuck with checks, so when I bounce I prefer cash in hand\nYou know my first week looking crazy due to high demand\nCause people don't buy music in this day and age\nThey buy the brand\nThere's ups and downs, don't get me wrong\nBut back when I ain't have shit\nFelt like I woulda sold my soul to make it with this rap shit\nThank God, he never let Lucifer close enough to ask\nLet me attain it by workin' hard and busting my ass\nAchieved a lot in life, but what's a lot with more to gain?\nAt least I don't drink to avoid the hurt\nWe call that champagne\n\n[Outro]\nCome some more into my sight...","img_url":"https://t2.genius.com/unsafe/218x218/https%3A%2F%2Fimages.genius.com%2F8547782914f9e616dd58d1f889f60604.672x671x1.jpg","artist_id":141,"album_id":673},"952":{"id":952,"title":"Black

fragrance\nHold up, you ain't never gotta say shit\nUh, and I know your taste is\nA little bit, hmm, high maintenance\nUh, everybody else basic\nYou live life on an everyday basis\nWith poetic justice, poetic justice\nIf I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room\nWould you trust it?\nI mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when\nYou're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen\nBetter yet, where your friends and 'em?\nI really wanna know you all\nI really wanna show you off\nFuck that, pour up plenty of champagne\nCold nights when you curse this name\nYou called up your girlfriends\nAnd y'all curled in that little bitty Range\nI heard that she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party\nNigga, don't approach her with that Atari\nNigga, that ain't good

someone\nWhen you figure out it's alright here in the city\nAnd you don't run from where we come from\nThat sound like poetic justice, poetic justice\nYou were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted\nI mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex\nYour natural hair and your soft skin\nAnd your big ass in that sundress, ooh\nGood God, what you doin' that walk for?\nWhen I see that thing move\nI just wish we would fight less and we would talk more\nThey say communication save relations, I can tell\nBut I can never right my wrongs\nUnless I write 'em down

many times she gotta tell you that dick is disposable?\nBut if she fuck a young nigga like me, it's over for you\nSol√°na, middle fingers up, speak your truth\n\n[Verse 3: SZA]\nYou could never

to sell clothes\nOne works down by the coast\nOne had two kids but lives alone\nOne's brother overdosed\nOne's already on his second wife\nOne's just barely getting by\nBut these people raised me\nAnd I can't wait to go home\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I'm on my way, I still remember\nThese old country lanes\nWhen we did not know the answers\nAnd I miss the way you make me feel, it's real\nWe watched the

went away for months until our paths crossed again\nShe told me \"I was never looking for a friend\nMaybe you could swing by my room around ten\nBaby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin\nWe'll be in

takeaway pizza\nBefore a text message was the only way to reach her\nNow she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her\nSinging out Aretha, all over the track like a feature\nAnd never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either\nBut me and her, we make money the same way\nFour cities, two planes, the same day\nAnd those shows have never been what it's about\nBut maybe we'll go together and just figure it out\nI'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch\nBut we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now\nWish I'd have written it down, the way that things

never saw him as a threat\nUntil you disappeared with him to have sex, of course\nIt's not like we were both on tour\nWe were staying on the same fucking hotel floor\nAnd I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment\nBut it was never just fun, and I thought you were different\nThis is not the way you realised what you wanted\nIt's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest\nAnd all this time,

Kodak Black \u0026 French Montana]\nSlidin' in the Cutlass and you know I paint it candy\nThen I pulled up in a bucket, but I used to want a Hemi\nAnd I'm pourin' up the round then I'm sippin on Remy\nI ain't fuckin with that white shit, I'm throwed off Henny\nPull up to the back, black Zac, chief rockin'\nAnd the Feds keep lurkin' 'cause the boys keep talkin'\nRitz Carlton, ran off on the plug about forty times\nForty niggas strapped, we the '49ers\nBite downnnn, Karlton Hines\nGot two twin bitches doin' 69\nJump off to the mula and you know that\n50 chains on, diamonds flashin' like Kodak\nI remember totin' .38, now I got a semi\nCould have been had a baby K, but I wasn't ready\nShawty say she like my Larry Pack, thought I went to Kelly\nNah baby I ain't want no Wap, I just want the Fetty\n\n[Hook: Kodak Black and French Montana]\nIt be hard to watch the cash when the bands keep droppin'\nGot the big 40 on me so my pants keep fallin'\nIt be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'\nAnd I ain't even tryna talk 'cause my jaw keep lockin'\nShe ain't tryna be a freak but them bands keep poppin'\nStill caught up in the streets and the feds still knockin'\nIt be hard to understand me, my jaw keep lockin'\nIt be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'\nBite down, bite down\nIt be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'\nBite down, bite down\nIt be

then tell me if I'm wrong or right\nIf I fell in love with you before I ever even knew\nI catch your eye then look away as if it never happened\nAt times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream\nIf eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you\nSometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nShe fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger

home?\nWhy you in the club looking like you out your zone?\nNow be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it\nText a nigga when your man leave you unattended\nOn a scale from 1 to 10 that girl's a hundred and I want it\nNo question, I know destiny well\nAnd though I sin the Lord blessing me still\nEvery saint got a past, every sinner got a future\nEvery loser gotta win and every

crown from whoever y'all think has it\nBut rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it\nPoof, boom, paow, it's like magic\nWith a flash and a BANG the crown disintegrates\nAnd falls to the Earth from which it came\nIt's done\nAin't gonna be no more kings\nBe wary of any man that claims\nBecause deep down he clings onto the need for power\nThe reality, he's a coward\nUltimately he's scared to die\nAnd sometimes so am I\nBut when I'm in tune with the most high\nI realize, the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side\nToday I know that we are the same, are the same, you and I\nDifferent kind of skin, different set of eyes\nTwo different minds, but only one God\n(It's only one God nigga)\nIt's for all the kings\nCause I know deep down every poet just wanna be

cried like a bitch 'cause I called him family\nHis name was under pressure so he did me dirty\nBut it's all hear say that shit ain't worthy\nDon't believe Jake he's not trustworthy\nSo fuck Jake Paul and what he says\nIf it weren't for Team 10 then he'd have no friends\nBut that's not all, let me tell you more about snake fucking Paul\n200,000 people unsubscribed\nWhat happened to \"Mr. Pass PewDiePie\"?\nAnd yes my brother did kiss my girl\nI'm still standing here screaming \"Fuck the Free World\"\nAnd yes, he passed me in subscribers\nBut the Logang Paulers are the riders\nJake Paulers you can't divide us\nPaul family are multipliers\nIf we're doing math he's older by two\nHe's got more subs, I'd hope so dude\nAnd my neighbours wanna move, shit I would too\nO.J. out of jail put him next to me\nThat's a punishment worse than the penalty\nBut I do fuck up, and sometimes I wanna quit it all\nSometimes I wish I wasn't involved\nSometimes I wish I could hate Jake Paul\nI really wanna see that motherfucker fall\nFrom the bottom of my heart, man fuck Jake
