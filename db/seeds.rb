tale\nFairy godmomma better tell you how I fuckin' feel\nLike you should fuckin' beat it\nOr fuckin' eat it while I'm on my period\nNow have a blessed day.\" Bitch, you serious?\nI'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious\nWhy you ain't fuckin' with me, you cut me deep as a Caesarean\nYou know I want you bad as a Benjamin, I'm delirious\nI want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman\nAfter the Dillinger hit him diligently and killin' him\nHis mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem\nThat's analogy and metaphor for you\nI should win a medal for all the ways I adore you\nThis is me talkin' cordial, yeah, I got some home trainin'\nThat ain't what you like, ain't it?\nWhat about if I was as famous as Marshall?\nWould you give fellatio in the carpool?\nCops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle\nSinging, \"I hope she's good enough\"\nMeanwhile you're chasin' her\nChlamydia couldn't even get rid of her\nPity the fool and pity the fool in me, I'ma live with the—\n\n[Bridge: Sample]\nThe game of love, love, love, love\nLa-la-la-la-la love\n\n[Hook: Kendrick Lamar \u0026 Eminem]\nShe doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more\nShe hates my company, yeah, she don't love me no more\nI tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door\nShe screamed she loved me like she never did before\nAnd I told her: (Go where you wanna go!\nGo do whatcha want to do – I don't care!)\nAnd I told her: (Go where you wanna go!\nGo do whatcha want to do – I don't care!)\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nSo needless to say I'm feelin' betrayed\nSnatch my house key off her key chain\nShe jumps off Wee-Bey from The Wire's dick\nNow she's chasin' me with a cheese grater\nHere goes that broken record cliché\nIt's all my fault anyway, she's turning the tables, I'm a beat-break\nShe treats my face like Serato, she cuts and scratches like a DJ\nEach day is an Instant Replay\nThey say what we display is symptomatic of addict behavior\nBack together but forgot today was her b-day\nShe cut me off on the freeway\nSimple misunderstanding, but just as I went to slam on the brakes\nThat's when I realized that she may be as crazy as me, wait\nBitch cut my fuckin' brakeline\nStepped on them fuckers eight times\nStill goin' 73, thank God there's an exit comin' up\nWhat the mother F-U-C-K's wrong with her?\nHit the off ramp 'til I coasted to a goddamn halt\nHit a fuckin' tree, now here she comes at full speed\nShe's racing at me, okay, you wanna fuck with me, eh?\nSnatch the bitch out her car through the window\nShe screamin', I body slam her on the cement\nUntil the concrete gave and created a sinkhole\nBuried this stink ho in it, then pay to have the street repaved\n(The fuck?) Woke up in a dream state\nIn a cold sweat like I got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave\nGuess I eventually caved though, ‘cause she's laying next to me in bed – directly aiming a gat at my head\nWoke up again and jumped up\nLike, \"Fuck it! I've had it, I'm checkin' into rehab.\"\nI confess I'm a static addict, I guess that's why I'm so clingy\nEvery girl I've ever had either says I got too much baggage\nOr I'm too fuckin' dramatic\nMan, what the fuck is the matter? I'm just a fuckin' romantic\nI fuckin' love you, you fuckin' bitch!\nCombative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex\nI actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events\nI said, \"Hit the road\" and after she left\nI sent that bitch a text, I said, \"Be careful driving\nDon't read this and have an accident\"\nShe glanced to look at it and wrecked\nToo bad, thought we had a connect\nNo sense dwelling makes, never been a more compelling case\nThan the model covered in L'Oreal and mace\nWho fell from grace eleven stories for storytelling\nWhile the whore was yelling, \"Rape!\"\n'Til her vocal cords were swelling\nAnd her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spellings' face\nStill they swarm the gates and my fancy estates\nTo greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace\nUnless you're Andrea Yates, don't ask me for a date\nDon't be late, well, the sentiment's great\nBut wait, think there's been a mistake\nYou wanted an intimate date, I wanna intimidate\nI have infinite hate in my blood\nIt's mainly because of the game of— (*Message sound*)\n\"Wait, dinner at eight?\", I have infinite hate in my blood\nIt's mainly because of the game of—\n\n[Outro]\nLove, love, love, love\nL-l, l-l-l-love","img_url":"https://t2.genius.com/unsafe/218x218/https%3A%2F%2Fimages.genius.com%2Ff35d0e008391018de2faba596a4c0fe3.999x999x1.jpg","artist_id":7,"album_id":38},"6":{"id":6,"title":"XXL Freshman Freestyle: XXXTENTACION","lyrics":"[Verse]\nAnd hell is just a government creation\nAnd all the information they solicit isn't nearly close to truth\nIt was clear since the alteration\nOf the books our children study when they said Columbus discovered America oh, the ultimatum\nOf telling you the truth but oh well I'm already in hell\nI'm tired of havin' patience\nSo I'ma sell my soul and say some shit that fuckin' bothers you\nJesus wasn't white nor black, I can't knock it\nWas somewhat a Arab and one hell of a prophet\nDon't understand why J.
